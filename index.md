# Fangyue Bao

PhD Candidate, University of Bremen

## Research
I am a PhD candidate working on international organizations, global governance, and education policy, with a regional focus on China and East Asia.

My research examines how international organizations (e.g. the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, UNESCO) engage with national education systems, and how global policy ideas are translated, adapted, or selectively adopted in different political contexts.
Methodologically, I use mixed methods, combining qualitative policy analysis and interviews with quantitative text-as-data approaches.

## Publications (selected)

## Professional & Research Experience
I have research and professional experience at the intersection of education policy, international organizations, and education technology, with a strong emphasis on team-based research, project coordination, and policy-oriented work.

As a part-time researcher within a large collaborative research centre in Germany, I contributed to a comparative case study on education policy in Cambodia, working within an interdisciplinary team and coordinating qualitative data collection and analysis.

Prior to my PhD, I worked as a Senior Product Manager in the education sector in China, where I was responsible for coordinating cross-functional teams (research, product, and training), managing multi-site education projects, and translating policy requirements into scalable educational programmes. This role involved project planning, stakeholder communication, and evaluation of implementation outcomes across diverse local contexts.

Across both academic and professional settings, I have extensive experience in collaborative work, project management, and knowledge translation between research, policy, and practice.
